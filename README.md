## Data Summary

| Quarter | MRR Growth (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| Q1      | 1.13           |
| Q2      | 5.71           |
| Q3      | 9.8            |
| Q4      | 8.34           |
| **Average** | **6.25**   |

**Industry Target:** 15%

## Key Findings

- The company’s quarterly MRR growth shows a rising trend from Q1 to Q3 but a slight decline in Q4.
- The average quarterly growth (6.25%) is well below the industry benchmark of 15%.

- Falling short of the target may impact market share, investor confidence, and long-term revenue projections.

## Recommendations

- **Expand into new market segments** to accelerate MRR growth.
- Invest in targeted marketing campaigns to boost customer acquisition.
- Analyze churn and retention metrics to improve existing customer lifetime value.
- Consider product enhancements or pricing strategies to increase revenue per customer.
